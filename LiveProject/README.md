<h2>Live Project</h2>

<p> During the Live Project with the Tech Academy we were in the process of building a website to clock in and out as well as track the time logged. During the two weeks I was able to assist I had the opportunity to work on the front and back end of the project. This project hadn’t gone live yet and we were still working on the basics of the layout and design. <p>

<h3>Back End Stories</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type:square">
  <li>Message Controller</li>
  <li>Schedule</li>
  <li>Time off Event Controller</li>
 </ul>

<h4>Message Controller</h4>
<p>Within the message controller I added the code in order for the program to check to make sure that the role of the user was an admin prior to allowing that user to view the Index. </p>

<h4>Schedule</h4>
<p>Within the Schedule.cs the Id data type needed to be changed to GUID.</p>

<h4>Time off Event Controller</h4>
<p>For the Time off event controller I added the code in order for the program to check to make sure that the role of the user was an admin prior to allowing that user to view the Index.<p>

<h3>Front End Stories</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type:square">
  <li>Changing Colors on NavBar</li>
  <li>Adding Pay Period to Drop down Menu</li>
</ul>
 

<h4>Changing Colors on Navigation Bar</h4>
<p>The navigation bar was to be the same color as the navigation bar on The Tech Academy’s website. Changed that in the Site.css file so that the two websites are visually similar with their color schemes.</p>

<h4>Adding Pay Period to the Drop down Menu</h4>
<p>The drop down menu needed to have an option to be able to go to the Pay Period. Added that in the _Layout.cshtml.</p>

<h3>Other Skills Obtained</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type:square">
<li>Working with a group of other developers that it needed to be clear who was working on what because if more than one person is working on the same part of the job then there will be a conflict when they try and submit it.</li>
<li>Communication is key to any project with multiple people on it working together. That way the same task isn’t being done by two different people at the same time.</li>
<li>I learned that sometimes what works for one person doesn’t always work for another if there is an error being thrown.</li>
</ul>
